# Blockchain Ramblings

It's been a couple of years since I first heard about bitcoin and blockchain, so you could say I'm somewhat late to the party by trying to learn it now. Of course, if blockchain turns out to be everything its adherents say it will be, then I'm early.

This blog is a journal of my experiences learning about blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and other digital shiny things. I'm going to note sources that I read (at least the ones I consider useful), and I look forward to doing a small project or two.

Based on what I've read so far, it would make sense for me to look deeply at Ethereum and its associated technologies like Solidity and web3.js. But that's at a later stage. Right now I want to build up to that by looking first at decentralized file storage technologies, and learn how these can integrate with blockchain.

As a practical first project, I'd like to put this blog on one such file network, the Interplanetary File System (IPFS).

### Is the future now?

I remember when the internet and web went mainstream. At one of my first jobs, I met a researcher who had worked at CERN with Tim Berners-Lee. The researcher spoke about the initial strangeness of the web and how barebones and ugly it had been before the advent of CSS. Blockchain kind of reminds me of that now. It has this _toy_ feeling to it.

There's nothing wrong with that. But I also remember that the internet, before it was adopted en masse, had already been developed during decades of research and fine-tuned by the use of protocols for email and ftp.

Blockchain just hasn't existed that long. Or maybe I'm comparing apples with oranges, since blockchain is just one more application sitting atop the internet. At any rate, it's worthwhile to make an effort to understand it better.
