Enough of preliminaries, let's get this party started! We're going to use [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs) for what it was made: to store some content.

The first thing I did was to head over to the [IPFS home page](https://ipfs.io/) and install it on my macbook. There, IPFS concepts are clearly explained and I'd recommend watching the [demo video](https://youtu.be/8CMxDNuuAiQ) to get started.

IPFS is based on Go, so make sure you have this installed before proceeding to IPFS. I'm not going to cover the install steps here as it's [adequately done elsewhere](https://ipfs.io/docs/install/). One resource I found useful after installation was the IPFS tutorials [listed here](https://ipfs.io/docs/examples/), which show you the mechanics of IPFS and different use cases.

Also, Coral Health has written a pretty good primer on how to use IPFS to [exchange encrypted files with someone](https://medium.com/@mycoralhealth/learn-to-securely-share-files-on-the-blockchain-with-ipfs-219ee47df54c). The tutorial combines both IPFS and [GNU Privacy Guard](https://www.gnupg.org/) for encrypting and decrypting files.
